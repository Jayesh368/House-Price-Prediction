Linear Regression

Property Price Prediction

Abstract: A key challenge for property sellers is to determine the sale 
price of the property. The ability to predict the exact property value is 
beneficial for property investors as well as for buyers to plan their
finances according to the price trend. The property prices depend on the
number of features like the property area, basement square footage, year
built, number of bedrooms, and so on. 

Problem Statement: Use regression 
analysis to predict the price of a property


Scope: 
	● Exploratory data analysis 
	● Feature selection using various criteria 
	● Training linear regression model for prediction


Learning Outcome: 
The students will get a better understanding of how the variables are 
linked to each other and how the EDA approach will help them gain more 
insights and knowledge about the data that we have.
